ok, so here's the thing... i've played Storm8's Vampires! Live to death.

I have completed all missions to level 3, which is all you can do, at the time
I created this...

so now, I have all these energy points and frenzy points sitting idle, and I
said... i don't want to do this shit manually anymore...

so i sniffed the traffic from my phone, found out how the requests went through
got my cookies that i needed for logging in, and spent some time reverse-
engineering the silly URL obfuscator that Storm8 uses for their links...

i'm pushing this to github 1) to give others the chance to play with it...
and 2) in hopes that Storm8 changes their linking around a bit to break this
(and any other automatic scripts out there) so i can do it all over again...

fun stuff...

sniff your traffic with tcpdump-android or look for the sqlite3 databases that
vampires live! uses so you can find your cookie data, then plop it into a
config file, and enjoy...
